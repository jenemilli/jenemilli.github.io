My GitHub account was created on September 9th. With this account, I am able to have access and collaborate on projects.
Right now, my repository has no changes yet. It also allows me to open the repository in external editors or websites. Here, I can store all of my project files. 
To clone the repository on my local computer, I created a new folder called "GitHub" and in that folder is anther folder called "jenemilli.github.io". I cloned the repository and saved it to that folder.
